## Legend

-   ðŸ˜Š : Positive Scenarios
-   ðŸ˜¢ : Negative Scenarios

## Defects / Observations

-   Endpoint should return Response Status 403 Forbidden when using methods such as POST

-   Endpoint should be lowercase getNavPriceList -> getnavpricelist

-   Endpoint should utilise CORS instead of JSONP as it supports better error-handling and improved security

-   Open Point: Should all currency be in AUD? I noticed 2 currencyCode field set as USD
